# Ozyme-Engine
A multi-platform engine for creating digital experiences. 

More specifically this will be an engine for creating video games, web applications, animations, and simulations with the help of Artificial Intelligence. 

The Ozyme Engine will be Free to use and Open Source. 

I am going to start with making an editor with Three.js, though eventually, I want to make this into a full blown Engine.
My Knowledge on how to make a Digital Engine is little to none. Though for some reason I feel heavily inclined to create one. So I will.
